- All the names of the CLI options have been prefixed with :option:`--exe-` to
  prevent name clashes with other plugins options.
- It is easier to define the settings to execute the runner shell script for a
  test case thanks to a dedicated section in test-settings.yaml.

  are not used both.
- Output directory creation no longer fails when the input directory tree has
